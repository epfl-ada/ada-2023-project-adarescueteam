# A beer tale: 2010's gluten-free bloom and stereotypes around gluten-free consumption.

## Abstract 
During the 2010's, gluten-free food made a breakthrough and was much more available in general shops. However, in France and Belgium, a lot of stereotypes emerged on people buying and consumming gluten-free products and described their emergence just as a trend that would pass. One of those stereotypes is about the persona of gluten-free buyers, often described as urban snobbish people who wants to distinguish socially by consumming non-usual products, called "Bobo" in european French-speaking areas. One other stereotype is the quality of gluten-free products, which are often targeted as less tasteful or interesting in a gustatory point of view. This work will try to characterize this emergence of gluten-free products through the example of beers, as well as demystifying or validating the stereotypes that associated with it.

## Research Questions:
    - Was there actually an increase in consumption of gluten-free produces during the 2010's?
    - Is this phenomenum only European or also affects other world regions?
    - Can sociological particularities be seen between gluten-free beers drinkers and the general population of beer drinker?
    - Is there actual differences in the taste of gluten-free beers and comparable beers?

## Methods:
